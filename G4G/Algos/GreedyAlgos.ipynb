    "* Greedy is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that of fers the most obvious and immediate benefit. Greedy algorithms are used for optimization problems\n",
    "* If a Greedy Algorithm can solve a problem, then it generally becomes the best method to solve that problem as the Greedy algorithms are in general more efficient than other techniques like Dynamic Programming. But Greedy algorithms cannot always be applied"
